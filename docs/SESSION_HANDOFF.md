# Session Handoff

## S053/S059 certification queue — 2026-10-02

- PR #618 merged the opt-in S053 Beta Evidence scenario to `main` as `c944876a08bd1bfa6db9ab69900b3547a102513a`. The tooling now requires setup-required failure evidence, review-first/no-silent-write behavior, explicit Apply persistence, pricing refresh, reload persistence, foreign draft/apply denial, exact deployment-SHA correlation, and retained responsive screenshots.
- No full `mode=full, scenario=s053` run has been dispatched from this connector session because the available GitHub integration does not expose workflow dispatch. S053 therefore remains `READY`, not `DONE`.
- S059 readiness has been reconciled from current `main`: S051 is DONE, PR #564 is merged, the ADR-010 magic-link/session contract is implemented, and no competing S059 PR/branch is open. This governance branch promotes S059 to `READY` for bounded browser/security certification only.
- S059 must never retain raw access URLs/tokens, cookies, request headers, response bodies, or bearer material in evidence. Expiry must be proven from the current contract without adding a test-only public TTL/backdoor.
- Canonical execution priority remains S053 first because it is the lower-numbered READY sprint. S059 may be prepared, but implementation/certification execution does not jump ahead of S053 under the Next Sprint Protocol.

## Design/backlog reconciliation — 2026-10-02

- Canonical Figma page enumeration is verified: all 21 documented pages exist in file `xImUa9CYUjx3Cb3zTrkfnY`; the earlier two-page metadata result was an incomplete listing path, not a file-structure defect.
- PR #520 is merged. S064's stale Assembly Catalog blocker is removed; S064 is `PLANNED` and remains gated by S053 completion.
- S053 certification must follow its canonical backlog acceptance criteria. The one-question clarification interaction remains separate TARGET work because production lacks the persisted answer/regenerate contract needed to certify it.


## Nightly release repair — desktop estimate visibility, 2026-10-02

- Classification: `NEW_WORK_REQUIRED`; base main
  `9e53cde9c35396bf5d5b2bd22b154c9b37e3d9de`, Sprint ID: NONE.
- Production Dashboard and draft estimate access were verified read-only in an
  existing signed-in browser session. Desktop estimate editing was absent after
  reload: the mobile section hides at `lg`, and the desktop section never shows.
- Branch `fix/desktop-estimate-visibility` restores the existing desktop display
  at `lg` and adds a failing-before/passing-after visibility regression. No auth,
  data, pricing, lifecycle, schema, or design-system change is included.
- Production API is READY at current main; frontend is READY at parent `1c107830`.
  Their intervening commit changes CI/docs only. `/health` and `/ready` pass,
  including database/schema readiness. No runtime error clusters were returned.
- Exact-main repository verification passed, but authenticated full-flow evidence
  remains outstanding. Historical Sign out failure was repaired by merged #561;
  no new current-head smoke run was available. Do not reassert database-auth
  failure from old PR descriptions.
- This gate must not merge the repair. Next: independent exact-head CI/review,
  merge through PR Autopilot, verify desktop estimate controls after deployment,
  run sanitized Preview estimating/portal/payment certification, retain mobile
  viewport evidence.

## Active maintenance: native merge queue — 2026-10-01

- Classification: `NEW_WORK_REQUIRED`; current main verified as
  `89a79d29d399c922b023ae4392514cd09708aa0f`. No viable existing native queue
  implementation or competing open queue PR/branch was found. Work is on
  `ci/native-merge-queue`, Sprint ID: NONE.
- Adds guarded one-shot label consent, dry-run/apply, exact-head native enqueue,
  and disabled-by-default automatic wakeups. Required CI now supports
  `merge_group`, running all product lanes and checking docs against the event
  base SHA. Existing required check names and protections are preserved.
- Ruleset `18958081` has no queue rule in the observed snapshot. Import the
  additive template after CI support lands, configure the dedicated token, and
  record a live group-CI trial before enabling automatic entry. The connected
  GitHub app cannot administer rulesets/secrets; no live activation or enqueue
  is claimed. See `docs/testing/MERGE_QUEUE.md`.
- Thirty-five focused boundary/contract tests pass. Full local root regression
  and final-head hosted CI evidence are recorded in the PR; live enqueue and
  synthetic group execution remain unverified until activation.
- PR #604 separately containerizes browser evidence. Shared package/docs metadata
  must retain both changes when rebasing either PR; this queue lane changes no
  browser runners, application code, auth, RLS, schema, or sprint completion.
- Next five tasks: review/land CI support; activate the additive queue rule;
  provision the repository token/label; record one dry-run/apply/group-CI trial;
  enable automatic entry after success and monitor failure/ejection summaries.

## Staging fixture and evidence repair — 2026-10-01

- Existing PR #561 reconciled with main `6a2d921`; preserved canonical design
  authority, current tokens, dependency lockfiles and Customer-to-Project work.
- Production and immutable staging API readiness now pass. The latest RC smoke
  passed login/refresh but timed out on Sign out at the default 1280px viewport.
  The account control is under More below 1536px; the runner now opens that menu
  and clicks the visible Sign out button. Logout and protected-route denial
  assertions remain required; no authentication control was weakened.
- The credential-free fixture stays off by default; no Preview or Production
  bypass was enabled. Fresh CI and live browser certification remain required.

## Current truth

- PR #597 merged as `3288f3c7a967b75b507b7544328c817a513fb835`.
  Production frontend `dpl_GmtT3say5KK8qY57PHU7QT1cWw2R` and backend
  `dpl_CRLBHggXh7zuJkUTBQioGVQH8HuZ` both identify that main commit.
- The production Supabase project was paused. It was restored on 2026-09-30;
  `/ready` returned HTTP 200 with database and schema checks `ok` at 23:52 UTC.
- Staging commit `9ca5876eef05daaa5e59ed6c39b2b52bbe6ce74e` retains both
  histories and uses the exact main tree `63d8faaa417f8dafebcc1e8aa68930fd1605c56b`.
  Repair run `36792529613` passed immutable backend identity/readiness and
  invalid-token auth initialization against `dpl_FX2x1wPMHzXYsfDcCRNB7WcipL7V`.
- RC smoke run `36793045095` first failed after successful Supabase login:
  frontend organization bootstrap called an obsolete API deployment (HTTP 410).
  A staging-only `BACKEND_API_URL` override now pins the verified backend
  `https://tradeos-costbook-6tij63lsx-billykshowalters.vercel.app`.
  Replacement frontend `dpl_46S63m9K9pebE3t1VV2niF3CP3Lb` is READY at the
  staging SHA. Attempt 2 reached dashboard and authenticated API HTTP 200, but the runner
  rejected a page-wide alert during navigation. Its credential-error locator is
  now scoped to the login form; a passing lifecycle/browser run is still required.
- S027 run `36792720050` failed before authentication because its Vercel
  branch-only environment query could not attest the effective Preview URL.
  `fix/preview-shared-env-attestation` now reads the complete inventory and
  requires the exact deployment branch override, preserving configuration
  timestamps and failing closed if that override disappears.
- This is operational maintenance, Sprint ID: NONE. No auth bypass, RLS,
  migration, credential, or product behavior change is included. Passing
  readiness alone does not certify authenticated workflows or the whole release.

## Verification

The new behavioral regression fails against original main and passes after
requiring the exact deployment branch override. Six focused evidence-contract tests pass.
Required repository checks and authenticated live results remain to be recorded
for the final head; no pending check is represented as passing.

## Active follow-on: Team & Time staging interface

- PR #562 adds the feature-flagged responsive `/team-time` workspace, assigned-job punches, breaks, supervisor review/corrections, employee/subcontractor classification, and approved-hours CSV handoff.
- The work requires the server-only project ref pinned to TradeOS Staging and matching the project reference in the configured URL hostname, and is explicitly disabled on Vercel Production. It does not submit payroll, verify jobsite location, or replace the existing login.
- The real phone-to-office test still requires dedicated staging worker/supervisor accounts, an assigned staging job, a protected feature-enabled Preview deployment, and a matching staging API/database path. Do not touch shared beta fixtures, enable Production, or claim live clock verification until that isolated path exists.
- The deployed Edge Function and migration source remain outside this repository; version them before claiming complete live Team & Time certification.

## Next action

Verify RC smoke attempt 2, publish the bounded attestation repair through normal
CI/review, and rerun S027 against the immutable replacement frontend with expected
staging SHA and the canonical sanitized Beta Smoke organization. Retain artifacts
and deployment identity before/after capture. Do not claim full release
certification from readiness or a repository merge alone.

## Next Eligible Sprint

Sprint ID: S053
Eligibility: READY in the canonical backlog; operational recovery does not start or complete this sprint.
Dependencies: S051 is DONE.
Overlap check: Live open PRs reviewed on 2026-09-30; no competing S053 implementation found.
Startup prompt: Reconcile current main and complete S053 startup before implementing its bounded review, denial, and provenance evidence.
