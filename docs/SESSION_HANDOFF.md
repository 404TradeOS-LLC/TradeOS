# Session Handoff

## Mission

S022 is the current sole numbered implementation lane. Readiness PR #324 and implementation PR #325 are merged; completion evidence and the remaining S022 verification contract are still pending. Do not begin S027 implementation concurrently.

## Current truth

- S021 implementation and completion evidence are merged; S014 and S024 are
  DONE through founder-decision PR #301; S020's legal boundary is resolved by
  ADR-007.
- S015 implementation PR #310 and completion evidence PR #312 are merged.
- S016 implementation PR #314 merged on 2026-08-24 with squash SHA
  `e1618db5926134d4cc6ec9b4c05fd754f4b2ca2b` from exact head
  `26304048985020ea8f49f701550112b2f6932d0f`.
- The shipped implementation adds server-derived brand resolution, safe
  fallback/color/asset handling, contrast-safe PDF header/body text,
  contact/trust-signal wiring, legacy contact compatibility, and focused
  resolver/PDF evidence without schema, migration, auth, RLS-policy, payment,
  signature, or portal-identity changes.

## Readiness contract

Brand Studio remains canonical. S016 must reuse the existing frame/generator
seams, preserve authenticated organization context, route/content-type
contracts, lifecycle and commercial semantics, safe escaping, deterministic
fallbacks, and forced RLS. No new renderer, storage model, asset lifecycle,
public branding, customer identity, payment, signature, schema, or migration
architecture is authorized.

## Verification and blockers

- Local App verification: 216/216 suites and 1,870/1,870 tests; focused S016
  suites 6/6 and 44/44; typecheck and diff checks passed.
- Exact-head Verify repository #1408, Docs consistency #1335, Dependency review
  #354, branch currency #82, Live documentation reconciliation #64, and Sprint
  governance #63 passed.
- Authenticated production/browser PDF evidence remains unavailable because no
  authorized browser session or deployed authenticated state is available.
- No production credential or authenticated browser state is stored or
  required for the repository-side implementation.

## Next action

Continue S022 verification and bounded repairs from the isolated implementation lane, then record completion evidence only after the acceptance, security, repository, and production/browser requirements are reconciled. Do not begin S027 implementation concurrently.

## Next Eligible Sprint

Sprint ID: S022
Eligibility: S022 remains the promoted sprint; implementation PR #325 is merged and completion evidence is pending.
Dependencies: S016, S019, S020, and S021 are DONE.
Overlap check: S022 implementation PR #325 is merged; this follow-up lane is the sole remaining S022 implementation/evidence lane and S027 remains separately blocked.
Startup prompt: Continue S022 route, rendering, security, and browser verification; do not implement S027 concurrently.
