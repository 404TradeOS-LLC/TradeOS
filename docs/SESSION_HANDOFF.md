# Session Handoff

## Today 2.0 dependency audit continuation — 2026-10-27

- `EXISTING_WORK_FOUND`, Sprint ID NONE. Preserve Today PR #798 at `d431ac5`; its final 26 Chromium cases passed in hosted run 40430809189, alongside 525 Web, 2873 API and 174 real PostgreSQL tests. Its backend build/audit fails on existing vulnerable dependencies.
- Extend existing runtime PR #795 in `/workspace/scratch/4360a72ccbf4/TradeOS-api-runtime-security`; reconcile main `93d1fff`. Preserve #799's exact body-parser patch and close it as superseded only after the consolidated repair merges. Leave independent moderate ip-address work to #786.
- Patch Zod directly and transitively to 4.6.7, preserve legacy identifier syntax with GUID validators, migrate one-argument records and typed enum pipelines. No role, tenant, RLS, schema, financial or production environment change. Major-upgrade review remains governed by AGENTS.md; no independent approval is claimed.
- Local focused 72/72 and high-severity audit pass; full exact-head source and hosted PostgreSQL evidence must be recorded in the runtime upgrade document/PR.
- Next five: finish full compatibility checks; publish/review #795 on the existing branch; clear dependency audit through normal required gates; reconcile/retest #798 on the landed security baseline; resume authenticated/field/domain/Athena acceptance without retrying the declined sign-in automatically.


## Costbook picker ergonomics and browser recovery — 2026-10-23

- Sprint ID: NONE; founder-authorized Figma-to-code continuation.
  `NEW_WORK_REQUIRED`: main `e17a166d` includes #773/#774/#785, but only
  Custom Item sizing shipped in #785. The open queue and remote branches do
  not implement catalog-picker target sizing. The historical Figma branch
  was absent; use `feat/figma-to-code-completion` from current main.
- Scope: catalog Search/Section/Quantity 44px below 1024, 32px above; Add,
  Clear, Select and Taxable targets 44px. No payload, pricing, auth/RLS,
  defaults, query, mapping or persistence behavior changes.
- Added four actual-production-component cases with synthetic transport.
  Local Chromium 153 was recovered from an npm-packaged binary after the
  Playwright CDN returned invalid archives. All twelve component cases pass
  across 390/768/1024/1440; Web 507/507, lint, TypeScript and build pass.
  Local browser evidence does not replace required hosted current-head CI.
- Staging runtime certification remains separate: the latest inspected READY
  web/API pair was different older SHAs. No new real-login, tenant-isolation,
  Add persistence or reload claim. Fixture credentials remain in governed
  workflow secrets; no secret is exposed or browser auth bypass introduced.
- Next five: publish this scoped PR; verify twelve hosted browser cases;
  reconcile starter recipe selection in Figma; align staging through the
  existing governed process; execute real-login tenant/Add/reload evidence.

## Openings/appliance retarget and validation — PR #774 (2026-10-23)

- `EXISTING_WORK_FOUND`, Sprint ID: NONE. Existing branch
  `feat/costbook-openings-appliance-gaps-20261018` retained; original head
  `45278dcf`. Parent #773 is verified merged as `ef983efc`, with a landed tree
  identical to reviewed head `97709786`. Retarget #774 to main and reconcile
  the squash-merge ancestry without duplicating the parent's kitchen recipes.
- Preserve main's Estimate Builder changes, Figma checkpoint, dependencies and
  all three research scopes. Catalog total: 107. No schema, auth/RLS, financial
  policy, supplier pricing or Estimate snapshot change. Keep qualified
  installation, product-specific instructions and native EA mapping explicit.
- The JELD-WEN JII001 source repair is retained. Hono 4.13.13 is already on
  main through merged #783; the retargeted diff must contain no lockfile change.
- Fresh focused API/type/build/docs validation and hosted exact-head checks
  are required after reconciliation. No staging, browser or production
  certification is claimed; this task leaves #774 open after revalidation.
- Next five: validate the reconciled tree; publish to the existing branch;
  reconcile source/lockfile review findings; verify fresh required checks;
  record remaining review/certification limits for a separate merge decision.

## Retained parent review checkpoint

The following #773 checkpoint predates its verified merge as `ef983efc`;
its pending-merge instructions are historical. The retained Figma/runtime
certification boundaries remain in force.

## Costbook kitchen recipe reconciliation — PR #773 (2026-10-23)

- `EXISTING_WORK_FOUND`, Sprint ID: NONE. Continue
  `feat/costbook-kitchen-assembly-gaps-20261018`; original head `955492cb`.
  Reconcile with main `762bb992`, retaining its Estimate Builder implementation
  and the Figma handoff below. No new feature branch or numbered sprint.
- Preserve two price-neutral research scopes (wall cabinet EA, straight-run
  laminate LF), registered sources and tenant-owned exact-unit mapping.
  Catalog total: 104. No schema, authorization, RLS, financial policy or
  Estimate snapshot change; rollback is revert of the additive PR.
- The original head passed all four required checks, including live PostgreSQL
  integration/migration rehearsal. All three earlier inline findings are fixed
  and resolved. The reconciled head still requires fresh required CI and
  reviewed-head evidence before merge; authenticated mapping/install remains
  a separate nonproduction certification gate.
- Next five: validate the reconciled tree; publish on the existing branch;
  reconcile the stale review; verify exact-head checks and protected merge;
  verify landed main before retargeting and revalidating stacked PR #774.

## Retained Figma handoff checkpoint

The following checkpoint is preserved from main. PR #785 subsequently merged
as `762bb992`; its earlier pending-review text is historical. Its runtime and
certification limitations remain in force.

## Active bounded mission — Custom Item control ergonomics

Sprint ID: NONE. Founder-authorized Figma-to-code continuation, not a new
numbered sprint or release-certification claim.

- Classification: `NEW_WORK_REQUIRED` for scoped sizing/alignment only.
  Main `218639bc8d2ff2aa95d586e7dc072355bdf8e69e` includes prior progressive
  entry, explicit cost, preview retry and mapping keyboard repairs. Open PRs
  #782/#778/#775/#774/#773/#772/#744/#702 do not implement this repair.
- Branch: `fix/estimate-custom-controls`, isolated worktree from current main.
  The old `feat/figma-to-code-completion` lane is retained with its separate
  history; PR #781 already merged its preview-retry implementation.
- Changes: only Custom Item phone/tablet text-input sizing, Add/select and
  Taxable label targets, label spacing and desktop control alignment. Shared
  primitives, DOM order, mutation payloads, validation, defaults, and
  pending/failure/success behavior are preserved.
- Figma: authoritative handoff `793:11017` in master
  `xImUa9CYUjx3Cb3zTrkfnY`; sixteen initial/pending/failure/invalid specimens
  at 390/768/1024/1440 exist. These are design targets, not full-app runtime
  certification. The entire illustrated shell is outside this code slice.
- Verification: Web 507/507, lint, TypeScript and production build passed;
  documentation ownership and 40/40 documentation tests passed. Hosted run
  39713763198 at head 0da62c1 passed all eight Chromium component cases
  (Custom Item and mapping at all four widths). All four synthetic failure
  screenshots were downloaded and inspected. Artifact 12398047963 has SHA-256
  c7331692622edd8d51b573231b67662b679bdc67149e9503c0246a51909efdcf.
  This verifies isolated components with controlled transport, not authenticated
  persistence, tenant boundaries, the full shell, or deployed runtime.
- Current-head review identified a Web scope-filter gap. The repair includes
  component tests/config, root runner manifests and the workflow in Web scope.
  A real temporary-Git regression fails before the repair and passes after it.
  Current-head CI/review for this follow-up remains pending; do not merge
  based only on the prior green head. PR #785 is ready for review, not merged.
- The local autonomy helper could not query PRs because `gh` is absent;
  authenticated GitHub connector reads supplied current open/recently-closed
  PR reconciliation instead. No repository guard was weakened.

## Next five bounded TODOs

1. Complete exact-head CI and review for the scope-filter repair; retain the
   passing component evidence and inspect any new findings.
2. Merge this repair only
   when every applicable gate passes, then verify landed main content.
3. Reconcile Costbook search/result/cost-review Figma states and canonical entry.
4. Reconcile Add assembly picker entry and canonical pricing labels/totals.
5. Verify an isolated nonproduction target and sanitized fixtures for the
   authenticated Install → Add → reload/failure-recovery evidence lane.

## Standing boundaries

Existing S052/S053/S064/S066 and Assembly Catalog browser certification gates
remain open until their retained authenticated evidence passes. Production
readiness is separate from implementation. Preserve existing auth/RBAC,
forced RLS, Estimate snapshots and financial accuracy. Production credentials,
protected migrations, supplier activation and ABC API licensing remain governed
by their dedicated runbooks; this mission authorizes none of those operations.

## Next Eligible Sprint

Sprint ID: S073
Eligibility: S073 is `READY`; S051 is `DONE`; founder authorization is explicit.
Dependencies: S051 — DONE through merged PR #538.
Overlap check: Recheck live PRs/branches before starting; this non-numbered repair does not advance S073 or authorize a second active sprint.
Startup prompt: Execute S073 from current main using `docs/architecture/S073_RELEASE_CRITICAL_RLS_COVERAGE_PLAN.md` after canonical startup/reconciliation; stop on protected policy gaps.
