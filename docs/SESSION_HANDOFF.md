# Session Handoff

## Mission

This session performed the S010 — Contract lifecycle normalization completion-evidence reconciliation: reconciling canonical documentation from `IN_REVIEW` to `DONE` using merged PR #276 as evidence. It is documentation/governance only; no application code changed.

## Current branch

`docs/s010-completion-evidence`, based on current `origin/main` `fcbf1fff342053d854ad73667c54a5e44c1bbfb6`.

## Current truth

- S006 is `DONE` with merged evidence in PR #95.
- S007 implementation PR #261 merged on 2026-08-21 as `e736bb6b92ce00441f2e0863ef3c4d34174571be`.
- S008 implementation PR #264 merged on 2026-08-22 as `dee5f98f0b46e98782b887fca80a63e55800cd65`. Canonical `sent` remains distinct from `ready` across estimates, queue filters, DTOs, and frontend normalization; `rejected` remains compatible with canonical `declined`.
- S009 implementation PR #267 merged on 2026-08-22. New proposal declines persist canonical `declined` through the compatibility `/reject` route; historical `rejected` rows remain read-compatible; S007's canonical Project side effects are preserved.
- PR #268 (bound Supabase serverless connections), PR #270 (restore CURRENT_STATE history after PR #258), PR #271 (restore Supabase pooler TLS compatibility), PR #273 (wait for request transaction acquisition), PR #274 (cover transaction acquisition contention), and PR #277/#278 (deploy/Vercel-ignore fixes) are merged infrastructure/documentation work unrelated to lifecycle normalization. Their database connection and deployment behavior must not be modified by lifecycle work.
- S010 is `DONE`. PR #276 merged 2026-08-23 as `fcbf1fff342053d854ad73667c54a5e44c1bbfb6`. `toDTO()` in `app/modules/contracts/service.ts` maps stored `pending_signature` to canonical `sent` using the existing `normalizeContractStatus` helper; the `contracts.status` check constraint, its default, and the `sign()`/`void()` guards are unchanged (Option A from `docs/architecture/S010_CONTRACT_LIFECYCLE_PLAN.md`). Persisted contract status remains `pending_signature`; Option B (canonical database persistence) remains a separate founder decision and migration. Three pre-existing runtime defects found during the audit (`void()` non-idempotency, missing transaction boundaries around status+event writes, missing optimistic-concurrency guards) are explicitly out of scope and remain unfixed; the canonical `viewed` state also remains unimplemented.
- S011 (Invoice lifecycle normalization) remains `PLANNED`. It has not been promoted to `READY`; that requires a separate bounded readiness/planning reconciliation and a dedicated governance-only promotion PR.
- S027 remains separately `BLOCKED/PARTIAL` only on authenticated rendered Costbook browser evidence at 1440/1024/768/390 and does not alter numbered lifecycle-sprint selection. No S027 evidence was touched by this session.

## Next Eligible Sprint

Sprint ID: NONE

Eligibility: No numbered sprint is currently `READY`. S006, S007, S008, S009, and S010 are `DONE` with merged evidence; S011 remains `PLANNED`.

Dependencies: S011 depends on S006 (`DONE`), but its readiness contract has not been completed.

Overlap check: no open PR currently implements S011.

Startup prompt: Perform a bounded S011 readiness/planning reconciliation and promote S011 to `READY` only through a separate governance-only PR if its readiness contract is complete. Do not begin S011 implementation before that promotion merges.
